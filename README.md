# will update as often as i can, but dm me on discord @joofi#9192 if a skin is missing because holy hell he has/uses a lot of them (scroll down and check first though, it will most likely be here)

# also, check the skin folder of a skin if the download link doesn't automatically come with the cursor that you saw him recently using on stream (ie: yellow cookiezi cursor with red trail as opposed to no trail). it will probably be there (if not, notify me).

ORDER: most used skin (currently rafis), then vaxei skins, then everything else is below in alphabetical order.

updates (m/d/y) (will delete these after 2 weeks or so of writing them):
- 11/09/19: didn't even notice that the followpoints for vaxei nomod ver. 2 were off, updated them to funorange followpoints. props to another guy on discord who pointed it out.

- 11/16/19: working on chitanda edit, that generic white/green hitcircle yellow cursor skin, azer, and other various skins he's using rn. will update when done with each.

- 11/16/19: added Azerino 23.01.2015 (pink cursor) and Azerino10032015 (blue cursor and diff hitsounds).

- 11/16/19: added rafis old and vaxei nomod ver. 3.

- 11/16/19: gonna go with the ryuk github system from now on, aka newest top and oldest bottom. still gonna keep blue cursor rafis at the top though.
